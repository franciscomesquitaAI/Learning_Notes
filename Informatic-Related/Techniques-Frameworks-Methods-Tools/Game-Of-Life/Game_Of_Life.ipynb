    "The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton. The \"game\" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves (https://conwaylife.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).\n",
    "- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation).\n",
    "- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.\n",
    "- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial configuration of cells can be created by a human, but all generations thereafter are completely determined by the above rules. The goal of the game is to find patterns that evolve in interesting ways â€” something that people have now been doing for over 50 years. "
