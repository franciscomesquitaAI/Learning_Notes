# Higlights:

In general it is a good library to be used with PyTorch in order to make fast ready to use Deep Learning models. I created a model capable of identify if an image was or was not Pizza. below i will write what were the advantages and disadvantages that i found so far:

## Advantages

-  Very fast and easy way of create DNNs

-   We can select pre trained architectures or train our own

-   We have some good built in functions to prepare data and visualize results

-   It seems that it is a widely used library and has a good quantity of possible different uses

-   Not so bad documentation (not extraordinary either)


## Disadvantages

- It looks too short for certain more difficult tasks

- it could have more pre-trained architectures directly implemented

- Do not know if it is that usefull to use if you already master PyTorch or Tensorflow

- Sometimes if you wanna understand what is happening you need to go read the source code
