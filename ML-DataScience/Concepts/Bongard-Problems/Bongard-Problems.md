Hello world!
# Definition

Bongard problems are a series of logic puzzles designed by the Russian researcher and computer scientist, K. M. Bongard, in the late 1960s. The puzzles consist of two panels of simple, abstract computer-generated images. A participant is asked to identify the relationship between the panels, and to determine the rule which applies to the first panel in order to generate the images in the second. Bongard problems are typically solved by identifying patterns or changes between the two groups of images.

Bongard problems can be used to train machine learning models to recognize patterns and find solutions to problems. By providing a set of images with a problem and an answer, machine learning algorithms can analyze the images and learn to identify the correct solution to the problem. This type of problem solving can be used to train robots to identify objects, create models for natural language processing, recognize patterns in data, and many other tasks.

# History

In the 1960s, a Soviet psychologist named Mikhail Moiseyevich Bongard developed an influential type of problem designed to test visual perception and problem-solving skills. The Bongard Problem consists of two sets of simple abstract shapes. The goal of the problem is to determine the underlying rule that connects the two groups.

People presented with the Bongard Problem are sometimes able to identify the underlying rule easily, but often they are presented with a baffling puzzle with no obvious answer. The difficulty of the Bongard Problem is increased by presenting similar shapes that lack a clear difference between the two groups. The ability to find the underlying rule can be improved with practice and insight, making it an excellent test of analytical thinking, creativity, and logical reasoning.

The Bongard Problems have been used in educational and research contexts, and have been used to measure the success of artificial intelligence programs. They have also been used to demonstrate the power of subconscious processes, and can show how humans can unconsciously find a pattern in a seemingly random set of shapes. In the end, the Bongard Problem is an impressive demonstration of how creativity and analytical thinking can combine in order to solve problems.
