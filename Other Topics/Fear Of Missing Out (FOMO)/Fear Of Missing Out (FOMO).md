# Definition

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out, is a psychological syndrome characterized by the fear or anxiety of missing out on social events, experiences, or opportunities. It is often fueled by social media platforms and the constant exposure to others' activities and achievements. People with FOMO may feel a strong desire to be constantly connected and involved in order to avoid feelings of exclusion or regret. This syndrome can lead to excessive use of social media, impulsive behavior, and difficulty in enjoying the present moment.

# History

The idea that you might be missing out on a good time is not new to our era. However, while it has presumably been around for centuries (you can see evidence of FOMO in ancient texts), it has only been studied during the past few decades, beginning with a 1996 research paper by marketing strategist, Dr. Dan Herman, who coined the term "fear of missing out." https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/bm.2000.23

Since the advent of social media, however, FOMO has become more obvious and has been studied more often. Social media has accelerated the FOMO phenomenon in several ways. <mark class="hltr-yellow"> <u>It provides a situation in which you are comparing your regular life to the highlights of others' lives</u>.</mark>

<mark class="hltr-yellow"><u>Therefore, your sense of "normal" becomes skewed and you seem to be doing worse than your peers.</u></mark> You might see detailed photos of your friends enjoying fun times without you, which is something that people may not have been so readily aware of in past generations.

<mark class="hltr-yellow"><u>Social media creates a platform for bragging; it is where things, events, and even happiness itself seems to be in competition at times.</u></mark> People are comparing their best, picture-perfect experiences, which may lead you to wonder what you are lacking.

FOMO, or the fear of missing out, isn't a recent phenomenon born with social media; it has deeper historical roots. Erin Vogel, Ph.D., a social psychologist and associate professor at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, highlights that the need to belong to a group has always been a fundamental human desire. Dr. Vogel also points out that our self-esteem is closely tied to our sense of belonging and approval from a community. When we feel accepted and approved by our peers, our self-esteem thrives, but when we lack that approval, our self-esteem can take a hit.

# Research on FOMO

As more research on FOMO is conducted and becomes available, we are getting a clearer picture of what it entails and how it affects us. The picture is not pretty, as there are many negative effects of FOMO, and it is more common than you might expect. Consider the following:
## Social Networking Sites

Unsurprisingly, adolescents use social networking sites at a high rate and may experience FOMO as a result. Interestingly, however, FOMO acts as a mechanism that triggers higher social networking usage. <mark class="hltr-yellow"><u>Basically, it's an infinite loop that the excessive use of social networks causes various psychological problems and these problems lead to even greater use of social networks.</u></mark> You could call this an "Ouroboros" condition:

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The Ouroboros condition is a concept derived from the ancient symbol of the Ouroboros, which depicts a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. In philosophy and psychology, it refers to a paradoxical situation or a self-referential cycle where the cause and effect are inseparable and continuously feed into each other. It can represent an endless loop or a circular pattern that perpetuates itself without resolution. The Ouroboros condition is often used metaphorically to describe situations in various fields such as science, philosophy, and even personal experiences where one's actions or circumstances contribute to their own existence or perpetuation.

## Age and Gender

One study in the _Psychiatry Research_ journal found that the fear of missing out was linked to greater smartphone and social media usage and that this link was not associated with age or gender. https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165178117309010

FOMO can contribute to peer pressure, leading teens to engage in risky behaviors they might otherwise avoid. Because the <mark class="hltr-yellow"><u>teenage brain is still developing, teens may engage in such actions without considering the lasting consequences.</u></mark>

## Life Satisfaction Rating

Fear of missing out was found to be associated with a lower sense of having one's needs met as well as a lower feeling of life satisfaction in general. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563213000800?via%3Dihub

It appears that FOMO is linked to both feeling a need to engage in social media and increasing that engagement. This means that FOMO and social media habits may contribute to a negative, self-perpetuating cycle (The Ouroboros condition pointed above).

## Potential Dangers of FOMO

Aside from increased feelings of unhappiness, fear of missing out can lead to greater involvement in unhealthy behaviors. For example, FOMO was linked to distracted driving, which in some cases can be deadly.

# Resist and overcome FOMO

- **Remember what you’re not seeing on social media:** Remember that people aren’t typically posting the more ordinary aspects of their day, such as working at their computer or cleaning. Not everyone’s day is jam-packed with excitement 24/7.

- **Be purposeful with your time:**  When you’re content with how you’re spending your time, you’ll be less concerned with how others are spending theirs.

- **Know your triggers:** Often, it can be helpful to figure out exactly what is causing you to experience FOMO. If you find that the cause of your FOMO is your phone, put it in a different room unless you need to use it to avoid the temptation of going on social media. If a certain person is regularly causing you to experience FOMO, you may want to consider limiting your time around them.

- **Change your focus:** Rather than focusing on what you lack, try noticing what you have.

- **Quit social media:** If you can't resist the temptation to see what other people are posting, it's best to put social media to one side, at least for a while.

- **See a therapist:** [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/) (CBT) can help break habits that are leading to FOMO, such as overusing social media. This type of therapy involves working with a therapist to examine your emotions, thoughts and actions to help regain a sense of control.

# Conclusion

Although FOMO is strongly correlated with social media usage, it is important to remember that it is a very real and common feeling among people of all ages. Everyone feels a certain level of FOMO at different times in their lives.

Fear of missing out is a relatively new construct that needs the attention of the clinical community due to its diagnostic implications in treatment processes. It is associated to problematic social media usage and can be experienced as a range of negative emotions and feelings related to the need to belong.

FOMO is a prevalent emotion that often hinders our ability to fully relish our lives. By delving into its underlying causes and recognizing its signs, we can proactively address and conquer this fear of missing out, thereby unlocking the potential to lead more fulfilling lives. It's crucial to remind ourselves that FOMO is merely a sensation, not a reality, and we have the power to rise above it.
