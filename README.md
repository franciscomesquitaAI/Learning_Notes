.md files, also known as Markdown files, are plaintext documents that use a lightweight markup language called Markdown. Markdown allows users to format text using simple syntax such as asterisks for emphasis, headers with hash symbols, and links with brackets and parentheses. Markdown files can be easily converted into HTML or other formats such as PDF or Word. They are commonly used for writing documentation, notes, and blog posts.
